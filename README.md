# Productivity

The main focus of our app will be college students, who struggle with deadlines and postpone completing work.
## Function
There will be many kinds of todolist - no deadline (reading book list or grocery list) or deadline (homework list) - the type will be chosen by users

In the dashboard, it will display two columns: one for the upcoming event need to do and one for the no deadline (for example, book needs to read)

User can select a date from the calendar

Then the UI will show a panel for notes on that specific date


Todo items will have tags & the user can filter todos based on tags
